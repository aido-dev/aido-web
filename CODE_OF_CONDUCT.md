# aido Code of Conduct

We want the aido community to be a safe, collaborative place for contributors, users, and maintainers. This document sets expectations for conduct in all aido spaces (Issues, Pull Requests, Discussions, code reviews, and any project-related communication).

## Our Principles
- Be respectful, inclusive, and considerate of different backgrounds and perspectives.
- Assume good intent; give constructive, actionable feedback.
- Keep conversations focused on the work; critique ideas, not people.
- Protect privacy and confidentiality: do not share secrets, tokens, personal data, or private content.
- Be mindful when using AI: models can be wrong or biased. Verify claims before presenting them as facts.

## Unacceptable Behavior
There is zero tolerance for harassment, discrimination, or any conduct that makes participation unsafe or hostile.
- Harassment, discrimination, or hate speech.
- Personal attacks, insults, or sustained disruption.
- Sexualized language or imagery; unwelcome sexual attention.
- Doxxing or sharing others’ private information without consent.
- Posting sensitive information (e.g., credentials, tokens, private keys).
- Any conduct that makes participation unsafe or hostile.

## Scope
This Code applies within all aido project spaces and when representing the project in public. It covers maintainers, contributors, users, and anyone engaging with the project.

## Reporting Concerns
If you experience or witness a Code of Conduct issue:
Primary maintainer contact: @dvirdung (GitHub).
- Prefer a private report to the maintainers. If a dedicated contact is unavailable, open a minimal public issue asking for a private channel, without sensitive details.
- If immediate safety is at risk, use platform reporting tools and disengage.

We will review reports promptly, keep details as private as possible, and take appropriate action.

## Enforcement
Maintainers may take actions they deem appropriate to uphold this Code. These may include:
1) Informal correction (clarification and request to change behavior).
2) Warning (with expectations and consequences).
3) Temporary limitation of participation.
4) Permanent ban from project spaces.

Decisions aim to be fair, proportionate, and centered on community well‑being.

## Security Disclosure
Do not report security issues in public forums or issues.
- Use the repository’s private vulnerability reporting channel (e.g., GitHub “Security advisories → Report a vulnerability”) to contact maintainers.
- Provide minimal, reproducible details; do not include live secrets.
- We will coordinate remediation and disclosure responsibly.

## Acknowledgments
This Code is intentionally concise and tailored to the aido project. It is informed by widely used open‑source community guidelines.

By participating, you agree to abide by this Code of Conduct.
